You can combine multiple PowerShell commands to format the output or place it in a file (or your clipboard).
Add the following to any PowerShell command with an text output to save even more time:

Put the output into the clipboard
| Clip
E.g. get-printer | clip
This will mean you donâ€™t need to highlight and copy the output, PowerShell will put it straight into your clipboard.

Format the output as a List or a table
| Format-List
| Format-Table
e.g. Get-Printers | Format-List
This will change how the output is formatted, most commands will show either a list or a table, you can use this to reformat it.

Save output to a file
| Out-FIle C:\temp\PowershellOutput.txt
e.g. Get-Service | Out-FIle C:\temp\PowershellOutput.txt
Will save the output to a file.

View the Output in filterable and sortable list
| Out-Gridview
e.g. Get-Service | Out-Gridview
